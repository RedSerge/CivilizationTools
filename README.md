# Red Sergeâ€™s Civilization Toolbox.
*(Currently there's only one tool, unifying patches for more reasonable AI and peaceful game experience)*

### patch.py - Civ 2 ToT v.1.1 patch, which unifies two patches, adapted for this game:

1) "attitude" patch for Civ2 MGE [https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/civ-2-mge-ai-aggressiveness-patch.509103/]

2) my own patch "Preventing mass betrayal after 1 AD" for Civ 1 [https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Cheating_(Civ1)]

Placed at .\Civ2ToT\py\patch.py at launch it replaces civ2.exe with patched version,
meanwhile making a copy of the oriignal version as civ2.orig.
civ2.orig file is used as a reference for further repatching.

This patch has been made to make AI more rational and adequately peaceful.
